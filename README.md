**CCV** is a cross-platform clipboard history manager. 

**Why do you need it?**

To address common issues such as, "I'm gonna share a link with you, just give me a moment... Oh, I forgot where I saved it!" With this tool, you'll always have quick access to previously copied text, whether itâ€™s prompt commands or even a favourite "text-goose".

It uses sqlite to store the entire clipboard history, allows you to search and reuse old items. Supported formats: *Text*, *Html*, *Rtf*, *Images*, *Files*.

The download file for the installation can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/ansirotenko/ccv/releases) page. In the future, it will be available on the [brew ](https://brew.sh/)

> Note: Currently the installers are not signed yet for Linux and Windows. Work on this task continues.
